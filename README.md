This repo is a Node.js server that uses Express.js and MongoDB. 

The database contains two collections: ```users``` and ```posts```. 

The ```users``` collection contains information about users, such as their name, email address, and password. 

The ```posts``` collection contains information about posts, such as the title, body, and author.

The server is also configured to use a middleware that provides basic authentication.
